*Where your music taste gets judged harder than your dating profile pics*

## üî• WTF IS THIS?!

Swipefy is the bastard child of Spotify and Tinder that nobody asked for but everyone secretly needs. It's a music discovery platform where you can finally treat songs the way you treat potential dates - with snap judgments and unrealistic expectations.

Created during a UI hackathon by sleep-deprived developers with questionable life choices, Swipefy exists because we asked ourselves: "What if finding your next favorite song felt exactly like finding your next disappointing relationship?"

## ‚ö° FEATURES THAT SLAP

- **Swipe Till Your Thumb Falls Off**: Reject songs faster than your crush rejected your DM
- **The "I'm In This Photo And I Don't Like It" Playlist**: For songs that hit too close to home
- **Ghosting Protocol**: Abandon tracks mid-chorus when they start getting clingy
- **Super Like**: For when a song makes you feel things your therapist doesn't know about
- **"The Ex" Category**: Songs you've swiped left on but secretly listen to when nobody's watching

## üöÄ ORIGIN STORY (OR EXCUSES)

This monstrosity was conceived during a 72-hour hackathon fueled by expired energy drinks and pizza that definitely violated some health codes. When the judges said "innovative UI," we heard "combine two apps people are already addicted to and make it worse." Mission accomplished.

## ü§î HOW TO WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS

1. Download the app (warning: may steal your soul and/or metadata)
2. Start swiping while questioning your life choices
3. Match with songs that will definitely ghost you in two weeks
4. Create playlists that scream "I have unresolved issues"
5. Share your bizarre taste with friends who will absolutely judge you

## üíª TECH STACK OF SHAME

- **Frontend**: Whatever framework had the prettiest logo
- **Backend**: Three hamsters on wheels and a prayer
- **Database**: Post-it notes stuck to our developer's fridge
- **Authentication**: We just trust you're who you say you are (please don't be someone else)
- **Deployment**: That sketchy server under our intern's desk

## üîÆ FUTURE DELUSIONS

- "Drunk Mode" that only shows songs you'll regret adding to playlists tomorrow
- "Red Flag Detector" that warns you about people based on their playlists
- "Situationship Playlist" for songs you're not ready to commit to but can't swipe left on
- Integration with your therapy app to automatically schedule sessions after certain swipes

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è THE CULPRITS

A collection of caffeine-powered code monkeys who thought, "You know what the world needs? ANOTHER way to make split-second judgments!" If this app ruins music for you, blame them.

## üíØ DESPERATE PLEA TO JUDGES

Dear Hackathon Overlords: We know this app contributes absolutely nothing to society. But consider this - neither did social media, and look how that turned out! Also, we haven't slept in 4 days and the talking unicorn in the corner says you should give us first place.

*Swipefy: Because dating apps weren't giving you enough rejection already.*

*Disclaimer: No algorithms were harmed in the making of this app, but several developers' dignity was permanently lost.*
